## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me

> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it  
> @richforever you're one nosey goof

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me  
> White boy, I see you  
> I see you, yeah, check

> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it  
> @richforever you're one nosey goof

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

You can check out the list here: [Spotify's top 100 hip-hop songs](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-05-20/best-hip-hop-songs-100-top-tracks/). I'm curious to hear opinions on the list.

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

I copied the list here for ease of viewing since sometimes the page wasn't loading for me.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me

> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182.

You can check out the list here: [Spotify's top 100 hip-hop songs](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-05-20/best-hip-hop-songs-100-top-tracks/). I'm curious to hear opinions on the list.

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

I copied the list here for ease of viewing since sometimes the page wasn't loading for me.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?

> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.

Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

I copied the list here for ease of viewing since sometimes the page wasn't loading for me.

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.

Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?

> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a

Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me  
> White boy, I see you

> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it  
> @richforever you're one nosey goof

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.

## Timeline of events since March 2024
Note: This is not an attempt to give you an historical overview of the direct and indirect back-and-forth between the artists involved. For an overview of the decade-long build up, see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3zxk3/drake_vs_the_world_megathread/kzl9sf6/) by u/Iminlesbian, which starts with Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's [_Control_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufJHc2EdBA).

#### _March 26, 2024_:  
Future drops the last single from his collaborative album with Metro Boomin, [_Like That_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9bKBAA22Go), with a surprise verse from Kendrick Lamar and backing vocals from The Weeknd. In Kendrick's verse, he called out J. Cole and Drake directly:  
> Yeah, get up with me, fuck sneak dissing  
> ""First Person Shooter"", I hope they came with three switches 
> Motherfuck the big three, n\*\*\*a it's just big me.  

#### _April 5, 2024_:
J. Cole surprise releases [_Might Delete Later_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_Delete_Later), his fourth mixtape, featuring the track [_7 Minute Drill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18RQuT3-c0), a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss towards him on _Like That_.  
> Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic  
> Your second shit put n\*\*\*as to sleep, but they gassed it  
> Your third shit was massive and that was your prime  
> I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine  

#### _April 7, 2024_:
J. Cole retracts his diss aimed at Kendrick, stating:  
> I’m so proud of that project, except for one part, It’s one part of that shit that make me feel like, man, that’s the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life, right? I was conflicted because, one, I know my heart—you know what I mean?—and, like, I know how I feel about my peers, these two n\*\*\*\*s that I just been blessed to even stand beside in this game, let alone _chase_, chase they greatness, right? So, I felt conflicted ’cause I’m like, _bruh_, _I know I don’t really feel no way_. But the world wanna see _blood_!

#### _April 12, 2024_:
_7 Minute Drill_ is [removed from streaming services](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/j-cole-removes-kendrick-lamar-diss-7-minute-drill-streaming-services-1235655544/) following J. Cole's retraction of the diss towards Kendrick Lamar.  
His actions divided critics and Redditors around the globe; some were disappointed and believed that it left a stain on his reputation, while others commended him for prioritizing his mental health over competition.  
50 Cent tweets, [""WTF how I miss this, @JColeNC call my phone ☎️ right now!""](https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1777436348745396594)  

#### [_April 12, 2024_:](https://i.imgur.com/gZiywNz.png)
Future releases the follow-up album to _We Don't Trust You_, [_We Still Don't Trust You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Still_Don%27t_Trust_You). The final track, [_Red Leather_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_j04lSGZWs), features a surprise appearance from none other than J. Cole himself. While this left many listeners surprised and confused, it does not appear to include a diss or response to the ongoing beef.  
Track 24 of that same album, [_Show of Hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkYx8cZCYw), features A$AP Rocky, who jumps in on the Drake beef by referencing his relationship with Rihanna, whom [Drake famously wanted](https://www.billboard.com/lists/rihanna-drake-relationship-timeline/2005-drake-rihannas-first-encounter/) as early as 2009.  
> N\*\*\*as in they feelings over women, what, you hurt or somethin'?  
> I smash before you birthed, son, Flacko hit it first, son  
> Still don' trust you, it's always us, never them  
> Heard you dropped your latest shit  
> Funny how it just came and went (Ha-ha-ha)  

#### _April 13, 2024_:  
A mysterious diss track by Drake titled [_Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\*_](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c36iyu/shots_fired_drakes_diss_track_against_kendrick/) is leaked online, calling out Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. At first, many believed the vocals were AI-generated, but over time it was revealed to be legitimate.  
> You ain't in no Big Three, SZA got you wiped   
> Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down  
> Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now  
> ...  
> What the fuck is this, a 20-v-1, n\*\*\*a?  
> What's a prince to a king? He a son, n\*\*\*a  
> Get more love in the city that you from, n\*\*\*a  
> Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, n\*\*\*a

Rick Ross drops [_Champagne Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zLBDmB6Fc), a response aimed towards Drake. In the response, he repeatedly calls Drake ""white boy"", and claims that Drake sent a cease-and-desist to French Montana.  
> N\*\*\*as leakin’ they records when we speakin' directly  
> If we keepin’ it gangsta, when you see me you check me  
> White boy, I see you  
> I see you, yeah, check

> That's why you wearin' that funny shit at your show, you can't hide it, n\*\*\*a

#### _April 14, 2024_:
Drake responds to Rick Ross in an expected fashion [via Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3vg1v/drake_fires_shots_at_rick_ross/), calling him a ""nosey goof"".  
> It's coming from Rick Ross the guy I did songs with he's gone loopy off the Mounjaro he hasn't eaten in days and it's turned him angry and racist he's performing at proms for money it's bad don't worry we'll handle it  
> @richforever you're one nosey goof

Rick Ross responds on [his own Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1c3wsbt/shots_fired_rick_ross_fires_back_at_drake_aka_bbl/), highlighting Drake's potential rhinoplasty and BBL surgeries.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.

This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.

The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [""Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.

Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.

There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.",False,False,hiphopheads,Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/

Spotify defines the streaming era as the time between 2015 and now. The U.S. hip-hop editorial team of Spotify (headed by Carl Chery) curated the list. The list is based on quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance. The editors' music and cultural expertise drove the ranking, streaming data wasn't taken into consideration.
